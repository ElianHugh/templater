# templater

*{templater}* is an attempt to bring rmarkdown template usage to [VSCode-R](https://github.com/Ikuyadeu/vscode-R). *{templater}* scans your installed packages for templates that can be used to create rmarkdown files. *{templater}* also comes with some basic templates that can be used to quickly get started on a project, without having to deal with all the extra bells and whistles that come with complicated templates. *{templater}* also allows for the creation of user-templates, which are stored alongside the package's templates.

*{templater}* is unlikely to be useful for those using RStudio, but I hope that it might find some use amongst vscode users.  For extra functionality (e.g. navigating to new files, IDE dialog, etc.) I am using the new rstudioapi emulation employed by VSCode-R, so there shouldn't be any difference in templater functionality between the two IDEs.

# Installation

Install with:

```r
remotes::install_github("ElianHugh/templater")
```

# Opening Templater

*{templater}* can be called by first loading it into your r session and then running its shiny app

```r
library(templater)
templater()
```

Alternatively, you can call *{templater}* through the addin interface, meaning you don't have to make a library call.

# Template Usage

Templates can be found under the "Use Templates" tab, with a choice between package templates (i.e. templates derived from installed packages) and *{templater}* templates (including any custom templates).

Once you have selected a template, input a file name and choose where to save the file. Clicking confirm will close templater and open up the new rmarkdown file.

# Template Creation

You can also use *{templater}* to create templates for later use. Navigate to the "Create Templates" tab, and type in your new template's name, description, and body.

The body contains _both_ the YAML header and rmarkdown body. When writing the body, make sure you include the YAML header first.
