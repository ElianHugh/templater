# templater

*{templater}* is an attempt to bring rmarkdown template usage to [VSCode-R](https://github.com/Ikuyadeu/vscode-R). *{templater}* scans your installed packages for templates that can be used to create rmarkdown files. *{templater}* also comes with some basic templates that can be used to quickly get started on a project, without having to deal with all the extra bells and whistles that come with complicated templates. *{templater}* also allows for the creation of user-templates, which are stored alongside the package's templates.

*{templater}* is unlikely to be useful for those using RStudio, but I hope that it might find some use amongst vscode users.

# Installation

Install with:

```r
remotes::install_github("ElianHugh/templater")
```

# Usage

*{templater}* can be called by first loading it into your r session and then running its shiny app

```r
library(templater)
templater()
```

Alternatively, you can call *{templater}* through the addin interface.
